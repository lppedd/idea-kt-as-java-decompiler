# Kotlin as Java Decompiler

Looking for the latest **plugin binaries**? Get them [here][1] as `.zip`  
<small>Supported IDE versions: `193.*` to `*` (inclusive)</small>

This plugin allows viewing decompiled Kotlin <code>.class</code> files as Java code.  
That means you'll be able to look at everything, instead of only the basic stubs.
