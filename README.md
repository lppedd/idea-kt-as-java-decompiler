# Kotlin as Java Decompiler

### ~~Available @ JetBrains Plugins Repository~~ (suspended until issue [#1][2] is resolved)

Looking for the latest **plugin binaries**? Get them [here][1] as `.zip`  
<small>Supported IDE versions: `193.*` to `*` (inclusive)</small> 

-----

This plugin allows decompiling Kotlin <code>.class</code> files to their Java representation
even when the IDE doesn't provide the option.

That means you'll be able to look at everything, instead of only the basic stubs,
without the need for an external decompiler.
